# ESP_fan_controller
A simple esp fan controller I created for an HP DL380p G8, it replaces the PWM signals from the motherboard

WARNING! ESP8266 may need a pull-up resistor on the pin used to PWM depending on the model.
Upgrading the heatsink on the RAID controller is advised as it tends to be the hottest running component (also stock heatsink is laughable).
